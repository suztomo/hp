Apache2 experiment

The configuration file of Apache has been modified so that the virtual host
can be send response to a request which uses arbitrary port number.

The /var/log, which is used to store logs, are created by
the script hp/utils/create_home/create_home.py as well as /var/log/apache2
and /var/run directory.

The apache works on their ports individually after following command:
        ssh suzuki@localhost -p 10422 apache2ctl start
The number 10422 is the SSH server port of virtual host port.
